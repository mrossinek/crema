# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Git integration (#44, !20):
    - will automatically track any changes done to the database file with git
    - must be enabled by setting the `DATABASE/git` option to `True` **and** running `cobib init --git`
    - Note, that you must have at least set a `name` and `email` in the git config!

### Fixed
- gracefully handle multiple terminal sizing issues with regards to popups (#58)
- catch messages on `stdout` during deletion from TUI


## [2.5.0] - 2020-12-08

Pypi: https://pypi.org/project/cobib/2.5.0/

### Added
- support for multiple associated files (#42,!19)
- interactive menu when opening an entry with multiple associated files (!19)

### Deprecated
- The `--force` argument to the `init` command has been deprecated. I don't think there is any
  benefit to providing the user the option to nuke their database file from the CLI. Instead,
  they can simply edit the file manually.

### Fixed
- always store years as strings to be compatible with bibtexparser
- handle invalid arXiv or DOI IDs gracefully (#57)


## [2.4.1] - 2020-11-01

Pypi: https://pypi.org/project/cobib/2.4.1/

### Fixed
- ISBN parser was missing the ENTRYTYPE and did not use strings for number fields
- the ISBN parser can now handle empty entries (#53)
- the TUI will not crash on stdout/stderr messages exceeding the window width
- the TUI respects quoted strings in the prompt handler (#52)


## [2.4.0] - 2020-10-14

Pypi: https://pypi.org/project/cobib/2.4.0/

### Added
- the `FORMAT/default_entry_type` option used for manual entry addition
- a **manual** insertion mode available through `edit -a new_label` and `add -l new_label`
- a ISBN-based parser for adding new entries (#45)
- the TUI-based `select` command (and corresponding settings) (#8,!18)
- the `--selection` argument for the `export` command (!18)

### Changed
- TUI color highlighting is now prioritized (!17)

### Fixed
- support URLs in file field during `open` command (#47)
- the TUI no longer crashes when encountering long prompt inputs (#48)
- the `edit` command can handle labels which start with common substrings (#46)
- support multiple ANSI colors on a single line (#50)


## [2.3.4] - 2020-09-14

Pypi: https://pypi.org/project/cobib/2.3.4/

### Fixed
- another AUR package installation error


## [2.3.3] - 2020-09-14

Pypi: https://pypi.org/project/cobib/2.3.3/

### Fixed
- AUR package installation error

## [2.3.2] - 2020-09-10

Pypi: https://pypi.org/project/cobib/2.3.2/

### Added
- option to default to case-insensitive searching (`DATABASE/search_ignore_case`)

### Changed
- clearing the prompt, aborts the command execution

### Fixed
- search command correctly handles missing arguments in TUI (#43)

## [2.3.1] - 2020-09-10

Pypi: https://pypi.org/project/cobib/2.3.1/

### Fixed
- faulty Pypi package

## [2.3.0] - 2020-09-10

Pypi: https://pypi.org/project/cobib/2.3.0/

### Added
- Logging functionality has been added. The verbosity level can be controlled via `-v` (INFO) and `-vv` (DEBUG).
  As soon as the TUI starts, all logging output is redirected to `/tmp/cobib.log`.
- Command line argument `-l` or `--logfile` can be used to specify the output path of the log. This will overwrite the `/tmp/cobib.log` location.
- the `TUI/scroll_offset` setting was added. It defaults to `3` and behaves similar to Vim's `scrolloff` setting.
- Configuration validation has been added. This extends the logging functionality to support more runtime debug information.
- popup window support: stdout and stderr messages are presented in a popup similarly to the help window

### Changed
- `-v` command line argument now refers to `--verbose` rather than `--version`
- Performance of the `add` command has been improved by not refreshing the database when outside of the TUI.

### Fixed
- bug when resizing causes the window width to become greater than the buffer width (#39)
- do not escape special characters in labels (#40)
- avoid special character encoding in file paths

## [2.2.2] - 2020-08-13

- renamed `default.ini` to `example.ini` in the documentation folder

### Fixed
- current line highlight after viewport width was not correctly reset
- correctly convert boolean configuration options (#34)
- fix crash of TUI in wrap command when viewport is empty (#37)
- default configuration settings are managed centrally and consistently (#35)
